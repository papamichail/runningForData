# Code book for Week 4 *Getting and Cleaning Data* course project

## Merging and Tidying the Data Set 

The steps that were performed in this project are:

1. The training and the test sets were merged in order to create one data set.
1. The measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement were extracted. 
1. Descriptive activity names were used to name the activities in the data set
1. The data set was labeled with descriptive variable names.
1. A second, independent tidy data set was created with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.


## Dataset
See the `README.md` file of this repository for on the data set that was transformed.

## TRANSFORMATION SCRIPT

The collection of the source data and the transformations listed above were implemented by the `run_analysis.R` R script (see `README.md` file for usage instructions).
